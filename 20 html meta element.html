      Think of metadata as "data about data. "It provides additional information
      about your webpage without affecting its visual content. Document-level
      metadata: With the name attribute, you can specify details like author,
      description, keywords, and theme. This information can be valuable for
      search engines and other services. Pragma directives: Using the http-equiv
      attribute, you can control browser behavior or suggest similar HTTP
      headers. This allows fine-tuning how the page is handled. Character
      encoding declaration: The charset attribute, crucial for proper display,
      specifies the character encoding used in your document (e.g., UTF-8).
