		<p>It is the first Programming 👍🙌💕</p>
		<p>There are more than two billion Internet users worldwide—that’s approximately 30% of the Earth’s population.
			 More than a billion general-purpose computers, and billions more embedded computers are used in cell phones, smartphones, tablet computers, home appliances, automobiles and more—and many of these devices are connected to the Internet. According to a study by Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group, there were 12.5 billion Internet enabled devices in 2010, and the number is predicted to reach 25 billion by 2015 and 50 billion by 2020. We will be learning the client-side programming technologies used to build web pages and applications that are run on the client 
			(i.e., in the browser on the user’s device) which is HTML 5 that we will going to discuss about in the near future.

		<p>Web Browsers and Web-Browser Portability

			A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.
			The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. 
			• Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct URL, enabling browsers to retrieve and display them on the user's device. However, ensuring a consistent look and feel on client-side browsers is one of the great challenges of developing web-based applications.
			 Browsers are available in many versions and on many different platforms (Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, Linux, UNIX, etc.). 
			 • Vendors add features to each new version that sometimes result in cross-platform incompatibility issues.
			  It’s difficult to develop web pages that render correctly on all versions of each browser.			
			In order to be sure about the code, The HTML5 Test website (http://html5test.com/) scores each browser based on its support for the latest features of these evolving standards</p>
